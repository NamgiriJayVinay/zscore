2. App A has used permissions <a,b,c,..> in background and caused battery increase by X% in background compared to foreground
3. Permissions <A,B,C,..> were frequently used in background in last day
4. App A has used permissions <A,B,C,..> in background causing increased CpuTime and Wifi Data usage
